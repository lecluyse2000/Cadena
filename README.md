## PasswordManager
This is a password manager I am currently working on using a custom hashtable. Currently a WIP and will be for personal use after I complete it.
It uses g++ to compile on linux systems, eventually I want to try to add windows support with cmake since I also use Windows.
This project is also so I can practice with neovim.
